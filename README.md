# FunLittleThings
Fun little code projects that I've made. Many of these are developed in Hackathons and will probably not be complete!

## Ideas
* [~~A tool that removes all .html file extensions from all HTML files within a chosen directory~~ DONE!](https://github.com/Natfan/FunLittleThings/tree/master/HTMLFixer)
* A tool which checks every half hour if it is <= 22:35 (local time), then ping 8.8.8.8 and if that fails then try to switch to NatFi every minute until success
* [Lister, a YT playlist generator](https://github.com/Natfan/FunLittleThings/tree/master/Lister)
* Commit your life - A program which lets you view all of the things that you've done, in a "GitHub" style format.
