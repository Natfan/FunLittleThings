# FunLittleThings
Fun little code projects that I've made. Many of these are developed in Hackathons and will probably not be complete!

## Ideas
* A tool that removes all .html file extensions from all HTML files within a chosen directory
* A tool which checks every half hour if it is <= 22:35 (local time), then ping 8.8.8.8 and if that fails then try to switch to NatFi every minute until success
