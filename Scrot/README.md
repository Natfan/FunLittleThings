# Scrot

## Overview
This is just a quick little screenshotting tool that waits two seconds before taking a screenshot of your entire screen. It's literally 2 lines long, but I use it when taking screenshots as it lets me switch desktops to remove the ugly scrot command from my BEAUTIFUL screenshots.

## How to Use
### Running
Just run `chmod +x scrot.sh` to give it permissions then execute `./scrot.sh` and wait two seconds for a screenshot to be placed in your current directory. You'll probably want to rename it with `mv`.
