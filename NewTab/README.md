# NewTab
*By Natfan*
I've done a few HTML pages and new tabs recently, but I thought I'd try to make my official one. The colour scheme and styling is based off [my Typographic YouTube introduction video](https://natfan.github.io/typography); a clean, flat design that mimics [Google](https://google.com)'s [Material Design](https://material.io), sort of. It's not super duper advanced like that and doesn't actually follow any official guidelines though, so don't get your hopes up.
