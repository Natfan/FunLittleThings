# NewTab
*By Natfan*
I've done a few HTML pages and new tabs recently, but I thought I'd try to make my official one. The colour scheme and styling is based off [my Typographic YouTube introduction video](natfan.github.io/typography), a clean, flat design that sort of mimics [Google](https://google.com)'s [Material Design](https://material.io), but it's also not super duper advanced like that and doesn't actually follow any official guidelines.
