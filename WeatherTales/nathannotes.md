# Nathan's Notes
### Used to take your memorable three noun phrase and place it into something funny and possibly more memorable
### Random line from the source text
### In this case is Frankenstein by Mary Shelley and is split by sentences
### Checks if the line is more than 10 characters long, to ensure that it is a proper sentence
### Also checks if it is less than 140 characters, so that it can fit into a tweet
### If this isn't the case, then it tries to find a new line
### It also checks if there are 3 nouns within the sentence, no more, no less
### Also, the nouns have to be three characters or more, so that the words such as 'I' are not added for easier retainability
### Finally, it outputs the list of the original words that will be replaced, the words that it is replacing and the fnal sentence
### Sadly, the list of nouns that it replaces with is not generated, so we currently use 'table', 'mug' and 'chair' as examples.
