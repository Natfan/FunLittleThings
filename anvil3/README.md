# Spotify Twilio Songs
This is a hackathon project made by [@BrandonSkerritt51](https://github.com/BrandonSkerritt51/) and [@Natfan](https://github.com/Natfan/) to attempt to combine cell phone texting with Spotify to allow users to create a constant playlist on the fly. Thanks to [Spotify.com](https://spotify.com/) for giving us access to development tools, and [Twilio.com](https://twilio.com/) for giving us access to use free mobile phone numbers.

# Todo:
* Learn Spotify's REST API and Twilio's API.
* Get user's song requests via text.
* Possibly allow users to confirm their request.
* Send the request that they made via Twilio to the Spotify code in order to enable the addition of code to the playlist.
* Possibly use [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) to store the application.
