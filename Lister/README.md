# Lister
*By Natfan*
## Overview
Just a simple YouTube playlist generator that reads from a file and redirects when the previous video ends.

## Ideas
* run a py file, enter the url you want then the program will append it to the file
* an extension for chrome where you click on a button and it appends it to the file
* client side app will be required to view all past and future vids in the list, and can be used to make side by side playlists, save them and let you share them with friends via serialization?
