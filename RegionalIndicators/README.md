# Regional Indicators

## Overview
A `python` script that allows you to convert text into Regional Indicators, so that you can be as sassy as you please.

## How to Use
Just run `python regionalIndicators <text that you want to convert into regional indicators> [optional flags]`.

The flags are as follows:
`-c` - Copies the output to your clipboard. Very usefully if you just want to run the code and be done with it.
`-s` - Silent mode, used to hide the output after running. Can only be used with `-c`, because why the heck would you want to run this silently when not copying to clipboard, because it basically wouldn't do anything.
