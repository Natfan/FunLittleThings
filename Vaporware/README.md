# VAPORWARE

## Overview
A `python` script that allows you to convert text into VAPORWARE, so that you can be as hype as you please.

## How to Use
Just run `python vape <text that you want to convert into VAPORWARE> [optional flags]`.

The flags are as follows:
* `-c` - Copies the output to your clipboard. Very usefully if you just want to run the code and be done with it.
* `-s` - Silent mode, used to hide the output after running. Can only be used with `-c`, because why the heck would you want to run this silently when not copying to clipboard, because it basically wouldn't do anything.
