# File Extension Reader

## Overview
Quick little piece of `Python` script that I wrote to one night at 1AM after being bored, watching some [Archer](https://www.netflix.com/title/70171942) and trying to find ideas on [this list](https://github.com/joereynolds/what-to-code) of ideas to code..

## How to Use
Just run `chmod +x ext.sh` to give it permissions then execute `./ext.sh <fileName>`. It will output the file extension if there is one.
