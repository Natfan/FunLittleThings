# b64

## Overview
A `python` script converts text into base64 encoded text and vice-versa!

## How to Use
Just run `python b64 <-edcs> <text that you want to convert`.

The flags are as follows:
* `-e` - Encodes the text that you input into base64 and outputs it to the console.
* `-d` - Decodes the text that you input into base64 and outputs it to the console.
* `-c` - Copies the output to your clipboard. Very usefully if you just want to run the code and be done with it.
* `-s` - Silent mode, used to hide the output after running. Can only be used with `-c`, because why the heck would you want to run this silently when not copying to clipboard, because it basically wouldn't do anything.
